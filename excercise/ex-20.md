Practical Exercise 20 - Exploring the Exclude Option
Exercise Description
In this practical exercise, our goal is to work with the exclude option for matrices to thoroughly understand how they behave.

Here are the instructions for the exercise:

Extend the include-example by adding an exclude option at the same level as the include option from previous exercises. Add a single entry to the exclude array containing the following:

exclude:
  - opacity: 75
Commit the changes and push the code. Trigger the workflow manually from the UI and take a few moments to inspect the result of the workflow run. Was the run successful? If not, which error message was shown

Now modify the exclude option by:

Removing the entry containing the opacity parameter.

Adding an entry containing two parameters: color, with a value of green, and shape, with a value of circle.

Also modify the include option by:

Adding an entry at the end of the array containing three parameters: color, with a value of green, shape, with a value of circle, and size with a value of medium.

Commit the changes and push the code. Trigger the workflow manually from the UI and take a few moments to inspect the result of the workflow run. How many jobs were generated? Which combinations were present?
